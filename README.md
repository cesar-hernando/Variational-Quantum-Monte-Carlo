# Project 2: Variational Quantum Monte Carlo

In this repository, we implement a variational quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm 
to find the ground state energy of the 1d Harmonic oscillator, Hydrogen atom and Helium atom. The code can readily be executed
by running the command 'python main.py' (Mac) in the terminal, after installing the required libraries stored in 'requirements.txt'. 
To control simulation parameters, please refer to the file 'parameters.py'.
